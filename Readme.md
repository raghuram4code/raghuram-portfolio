Follow these steps to get the project running on your local machine.

Prerequisites

You must have Node.js (version 18 or higher) and npm (or yarn/pnpm) installed.

Steps

Create the Project Folder Structure:
Create a new main directory (e.g., raghuram-portfolio) and navigate into it.

mkdir raghuram-portfolio
cd raghuram-portfolio
mkdir public src


Create package.json:
Create a file named package.json in the root directory and paste the content from the file block provided above.

Create public/index.html:
Create the public directory if it doesn't exist, and create the file index.html inside it, pasting the content from the file block above.

Create src/App.tsx:
Create the src directory if it doesn't exist, and create the main application file App.tsx inside it, pasting the React code provided in the next file block.

Install Dependencies:
Run the following command in your terminal to install all required dependencies (including React, Tailwind, and Framer Motion).

npm install

npm run dev


View the App:
The application will typically be available at http://localhost:5173 (check your console output for the exact address).

⚙️ Tailwind CSS Configuration (Optional)

For a complete Vite project, you would also need a vite.config.ts, postcss.config.js, and tailwind.config.js. While the primary files use utility classes directly, for production setup, you can create the following two files in the project root:

tailwind.config.js  postcss.config.js
